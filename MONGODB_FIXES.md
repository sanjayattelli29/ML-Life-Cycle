# Fix Summary for MongoDB Timeout Issues

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. MongoDB Connection Timeout (10 seconds)
- **Problem**: MongoDB buffering timeout was causing saves to fail after 10 seconds
- **Fix**: Improved MongoDB configuration with longer timeouts and disabled buffering
- **Location**: `src/lib/mongoose.ts`

### 2. Upload Process Resilience
- **Problem**: If MongoDB save failed, entire upload would fail even though R2 upload succeeded
- **Fix**: Changed upload process to succeed even if database save fails, with backup metadata
- **Location**: `src/app/api/transformed-datasets/upload/route.ts`

### 3. Backup Metadata System
- **Problem**: No fallback when database is unavailable
- **Fix**: Save backup metadata to R2 when MongoDB fails, retrieve it when needed
- **Location**: Multiple files

### 4. Frontend Error Handling
- **Problem**: Poor error messages and no graceful degradation
- **Fix**: Better error messages, progress indicators, and partial success handling
- **Location**: `src/app/dashboard/pre-processing/page.tsx`

### 5. Data Transformation Page Resilience
- **Problem**: Page would fail if some datasets weren't in MongoDB
- **Fix**: Fallback to backup metadata from R2, visual indicators for backup datasets
- **Location**: `src/app/api/transformed-datasets/route.ts`, `src/app/dashboard/data-transformation/page.tsx`

## Complete Flow:
1. User selects dataset from dropdown (fetched from MongoDB)
2. User preprocesses dataset using Flask API
3. User clicks "Proceed to Data Transformation"
4. System uploads to R2 cloud storage (always succeeds)
5. System attempts to save to MongoDB (with retries and fallbacks)
6. If MongoDB fails, saves backup metadata to R2
7. Data Transformation page shows datasets from MongoDB + backup metadata
8. User can still access and work with their data regardless of database issues

## Configuration Changes:
- Increased MongoDB timeouts from 30s to 60s
- Disabled buffering to prevent timeout issues
- Added exponential backoff retry logic
- Added backup metadata system for resilience
- Improved error handling throughout the system

## Test the fixes:
1. Try the preprocessing flow with a dataset
2. Check if upload works even with potential database issues
3. Verify transformation page shows datasets correctly
4. Test downloading and transformation features
